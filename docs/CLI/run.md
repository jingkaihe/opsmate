## Usage

### Simple command
This is the most basic usage of `opsmate run`, it will execute the command based on the natural language instruction.

```
opsmate run "what's the linux distribution?"
```

### Execute command with review

By default the command will be executed immediately without any review. You can use the `--review` flag to review the command before execution. Instead of a "yes" or "no" confirmation, you will be able to edit the command before execution.

```
opsmate run "what's the linux distribution?" --review
...
Edit the command if needed, then press Enter to execute: !cancel - Cancel the command
Press Enter or edit the command (cat /etc/os-release): cat /etc/os-release | grep '^PRETTY_NAME'
...
```

### Execute command with different model

By default, the model is `gpt-4o`, but you can use a different model for command execution.

```
opsmate run "what's the linux distribution?" -m gpt-4o-mini
```

### Execute command with different context

Context is represents a collection of tools and prompts. By default, the context is `cli`, but you can create your own context or use the predefined contexts as shown below.

```
opsmate run "how many pods are running in the cluster?" -c k8s
```

### Execute command with different tools

You can also use the `--tools` or `-t` flag to use a different tools. The tools are comma separated values.
The example below shows how to use the `HtmlToText` tool to get top 10 news on the hacker news.

```
opsmate run "find me top 10 news on the hacker news" --tools HtmlToText
